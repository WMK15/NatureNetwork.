# NatureNetwork: Building a better future, one volunteer at a time.

### Fulfils Project 15. Volunteer Matchmaking Platform for Environmental Projects

## Members of the group:

- **Mark Tran** - K23004163
- **Waseef Khan** - K23080255
- **Darren Weston** - K23037658
- **Jennifer Ikin** - K23030635

We have created a website named "NatureNetwork", that has a feed of potential volunteer opportunities with
a description, tags, location, and more that the users can see. Each user has their own profile with basic
information, as well as badges and their leaderboard rankings. Badges are given according to achievements
that the user has gotten, such as their first volunteering task, or maybe their 100th. This means that users
can pick and choose whatever activities they would like to do, and those who would like to post events can do
so to gain volunteers.

We used the MERN stack with Material UI to deploy the website and implemented a dynamic feed with Pagination.
In the future, users will be able to apply to these opportunities and add their own events/posts. Upon
completion, users would also be awarded points and badges, to complete the gamification element.

## How to run the program

- Clone the repository
- Open up the terminal in the main folder
- Do `npm run build` and wait for the files to install.
- After the files have been installed, do `npm run start`.
- The project should be working now! There might be bugs here and there, but it should not be fatal.
